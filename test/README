* Important Note: Test folder is to be implemented/compiled/run independent from dataspaces_wa.

This folder contains tests for various purposes.
- Currently contains only test demonstrating segmentation fault thrown from the communication layer
of dataspaces for multi-threaded put-get scenario with lock type 2.
  ds_drive.h: includes wrapper functions to use dataspaces API.
  ds_test.h: includes class to generate multi-threaded dataspaces put-get.
  exp.cpp: includes main functions generating the test case using ds_test.
  run.sh: quick run for dataspaces_server, multi_put and multi_get applications.
  
compile:
  # Variables DSPACES_DIR and MPICPP in Makefile should be modified accordingly
  make clean; make

run:
  ./run.sh s # runs dataspaces_server; DSPACES_BINDIR in this file should be modified accordingly
  ./run.sh p # runs multi-threaded put application
  ./run.sh g # runs multi-threaded get application
